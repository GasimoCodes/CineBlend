# Auto Frame Module
The CineAutoFrameModule automatically adjusts the camera to ensure that all target actor(s) remain within the frame. It dynamically calculates the optimal camera orientation and field of view (FOV) to keep selected objects visible while maintaining a smooth and cinematic look.

> This module overrides the Rotation and FOV of the camera set by any previous modules.

## Use Cases
- Cutscenes & Cinematics: Keep multiple characters in view during conversations or dramatic sequences.

- Gameplay Cameras: Automatically adjust to player and NPC positions without manual camera control. 

> For best results keep the camera at a reasonable distance from the Actors being tracked.
