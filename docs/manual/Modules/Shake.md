# Auto Frame Module
CineShakeModule introduces procedural multi-frequency camera shake effects. It enhances realism by applying Perlin noise-based motion to both the camera’s position and rotation, simulating a handheld camera type.

> This module is additive and does not override any values.

## Use Cases
- Handheld Camera Simulation: Creates a natural, slightly unstable look for a first-person or cinematic camera. Apply this to moving cameras to make it appear like the operator is walking.

- Ambient Effects: Enhance gameplay by simulating turbulence/wind while driving fast or falling, earthquakes, or rough terrain movement.

> For temporary effects such as explosions, use the ImpulseShake module.
