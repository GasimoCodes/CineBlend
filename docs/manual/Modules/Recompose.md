# Recompose
Recompose modules allows you to add an offset to the Camera's Position & Rotation. This is useful when paired with modules such as LookAt to reframe the subject instead of keeping it centered.

> This module is additive and does not override any values.

## Use Cases
- Pairing with look-at to keep target at the edge of the screen instead of centered.
- Offset Auto-Framing
- Offset camera on a spline path or following an object.
- Easy Camera-relative roll regardless of in-world camera rotation.
